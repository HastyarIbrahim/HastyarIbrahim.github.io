        <p>The world is a library that contains all the books that have ever been written, but most of them are indecipherable.<br> Many people venture to the library to find the meaning of life. It reminded me of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld library.

           <br> “Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species — the unique species —<br> is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.”</p>
